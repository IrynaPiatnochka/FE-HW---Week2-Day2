        <div class="content">What is Plant a Billion Trees? The Nature Conservancy's Plant a Billion Trees campaign is a major forest restoration program. Our goal is to restore and protect forests across the planet to slow the connected crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. Help us reach our goal and donate to plant trees today! One striking aspect of this new study is its demonstration that industries that work with and on the land—in particular forestry and agriculture—have a huge opportunity to step up to transform working lands and help them move from being carbon emitters to places that capture and store more carbon than they emit. And governments have the opportunity to make these solutions a formal part of their climate action goals.

          Around the world and in a variety of ecosystems, there are already examples of wide-scale success. In Indonesia, TNC is advancing reduced-impact logging techniques that are helping to lessen carbon emissions even as the timber industry continues to support economic growth. In Brazil’s Serra da Mantiqueira region, a broad coalition is working to reforest nearly 3 million acres of land in the next decade.
          
          And from farmers in Northern Africa fighting desertification by planting trees to New Guinean fishing communities planting mangroves to attract fish and store carbon, there are many more on-the-ground projects around the world setting the foundation for what is possible. At the global level, the Conservancy is working with policymakers and other partners toward an ultimate goal: To provide countries the incentives and support they need to protect forests and other natural carbon sinks at a scale sufficient to fight climate change.

          So, as we continue advances toward a low-carbon economy, we must not lose sight of the solutions that have been under our feet, in the soil and roots, and above our heads, in the forest canopies, this whole time. The fact is, the world won’t be able to meet its climate change goals without them.
          
          Nature can help heal our planet, if we let it.</div>

        <div class="content">Why help restore our forests? Trees provide so many benefits to our everyday lives. They filter clean air, provide fresh drinking water, help curb climate change, and create homes for thousands of species of plants and animals. Plant a Billion Trees can help us save the Earth from climate change and biodiversity loss. When we restore and conserve critical forests, we remove carbon and support biodiversity.</div>

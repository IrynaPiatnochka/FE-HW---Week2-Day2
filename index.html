    <h2>OUR APPROACH</h2>
    <p>We believe that ocean science, data and innovation are needed to engage communities and inform policy.  We see Mātauranga Māori, built up through generations of observation, as an invaluable resource, which enhances scientific knowledge. We consider the landscape connected to our priority areas and identify potential partners that could significantly advance their impact and outreach with our support. Through our wholehearted commitment to long term partnerships, we are able to collaborate and address significant and complex challenges for the ocean. Our trusted scientific advisors are a key source of expertise and support throughout this cycle. </p>
